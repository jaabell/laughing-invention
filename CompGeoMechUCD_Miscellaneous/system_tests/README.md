Basic system tests
##################

This file has some tests. You, person in the future, should think about these
things. These things might break what you think your code does, or your code. :)


* Dofs are numbered using ints. What is my systems max int?
* Parser (DSL) variables are doubles. These doubles get converted to ints. Can I 
fit the maximum int in doubles in this system?
